    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will regularize the deep neural network we built in the previous exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Dropout works by probabilistically removing, or “dropping out,” inputs to a layer, which may be input variables in the data sample or activations from a previous layer.\"\n",

    "https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-reduce-overfitting-with-dropout-regularization-in-keras/\n",
    "http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf\n",

    "## 1.1. Aims of the Exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This is an introduction to Artificial Neural Networks / Deep Learning with regularization. \n",
    "2. We will use Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "It aligns with all of our course learning outcomes: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tDistinguish a range of task specific machine learning techniques appropriate for Health Data Science.\n",
    "2.\tDesign machine learning tasks for Health Data Science scenarios.\n",
    "3.\tConstruct appropriate training and test sets for health research data.\n",

    "## 1.2. Jupyter Notebook Intructions\n",
    "1. Read the content of each cell.\n",
    "2. Where necessary, follow the instructions that are written in each cell.\n",
    "3. Run/Execute all the cells that contain Python code sequentially (one at a time), using the \"Run\" button.\n",
    "4. For those cells in which you are asked to write some code, please write the Python code first and then execute/run the cell.\n",
    " \n",
    "## 1.3. Tips\n",
    " 1. The square brackets on the left hand side of each cell indicate whether the cell has been executed or not. Empty square brackets mean that the cell has not been executed, whereas square brackets that contain a number means that the cell has been executed. Run all the cells in sequence, using the \"Run\" button.\n",
    " 2. To edit this notebook, just double-click in each cell. In the document, each cell can be a \"Code\" cell or \"text-Markdown\" cell. To choose between these two options, go to the combo-box above. \n",
    " 3. If you want to save your notebook, please make sure you press the \"floppy disk\" icon button above. \n",
    " 4. To clean the content of all cells and re-start the Notebook, please go to Cell->All Output->Clear\n"
